My DPhil research is in Southern Ocean dynamics, with particular study of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) from a Potential Vorticity (PV) perspective. The ACC turns sharply northward just downstream of Drake Passage, with many possible explanations, including Sverdrupian ideas of the Southern Ocean with the ACC as a western boundary current here. Wind may also play a direct role, with the ACC moving north toward the latitude of maximum westerlies. However, the nearby Scotia Ridge is the most significant underwater barrier that the ACC must navigate, so topographic steering likely plays a strong role. We will study this with a hierarchy of models, beginning with a quasi-analytic model rooted in PV dynamics, and ending with state-of-the-art general circulation models. We are also searching the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) data set for complementary processes and mechanisms for topographic steering around Scotia Ridge.

I began studying the Southern Ocean in my MSc: I explored the effect upon the abyssal meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of diapycnal mixing that is energetically supported by mesoscale eddy flow over rough topography, through the creation and subsequent breaking of internal lee waves. I developed parameterizations of this mixing for use in a coarse-resolution ocean model, based on transferring energy (which would otherwise be disappeared) from Gent and McWilliams (1990) parameterized eddies to mixing. With this energy pathway active, I found the simulated abyssal MOC responds drastically differently to changes in the westerly wind-stress. Previous theory and models suggested the abyssal MOC should slow under stronger westerlies, but the opposite is true under this energy pathway, with stronger winds generating stronger eddies, stronger mixing, and therefore a stronger abyssal MOC. This has significant implications for long-term climate feedbacks.
